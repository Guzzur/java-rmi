# Java Remote Method Invocation usage example

## Introduction to RMI

The RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is an API that provides a mechanism to create distributed application in Java.
RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a way that a programmer, using the Java programming language and development environment, can write object-oriented programming in which objects on different computers can interact in a distributed network.

### Expectations

In this reading we will taste a little bit of RMI, will see how to code it with two examples (simple and advanced-ish), and (spoiler alert, RMI is not dying, is already dead) give a modern alternatives in the conclusion.

### History

Responseâ€“request protocols date to early distributed computing in the late 1960s, theoretical proposals of remote procedure calls as the model of network operations date to the 1970s, and practical implementations date to the early 1980s. In the 1990s, with the popularity of object-oriented programming, the alternative model of remote method invocation (RMI) was widely implemented, such as in Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA, 1991) and later, the Java Remote Method Invocation.

Remote Method Invocation was introduced with the 1.1 release of Java (February 1997). In J2SE 5.0 release on September 2004 the automatic stub generation for RMI objects was added.

RMIs in turn fell in popularity with the rise of the internet, particularly in the 2000s.

### RMI General information

- Enables delivery of data between 2 and more different applications (usually client-server)
- Uses TCP

  #### The classic low-level model

  - TCP connections using sockets
  - Stream or object writing/reading

  #### The RMI model

  - Client calls methods on the Server
  - Object Oriented
  - Over TCP implementation, makes developer use methods, not low-level sockets and data management

### What using RMI looks and feels like

`client calls some object's method -> server's method gets invoked`

#### Server.java

```java
public class Server {
  someMethod() {}
}
```

#### Client.java

```java
public class Client {
  Server obj = new Server();
  obj.someMethod();
}
```

### What it akchyually does

`client calls proxy's method -> proxy -> tcp -> rmi layer -> server's method gets invoked`

## Architecture

TODO: Use structure schema

- Remote Object
  - The server on which the methods will be invoked
  - Exports and implements interface (list of methods) for further remote invokations
  - And... that's it, you are good to go, without any sockets or data transportation management
- RMI Registry
  - Comes with standard Java Development Kit installation
  - Receives interface and connection details from the Remote
  - Usualy located in the same computer with the Remote
- Client
  - Receives Remote reference/proxy from RMI Registry (object that implements the interface over the
    network)
  - Calls methods that are implemented in that object

## How does it work under the hood

- The server implements a remote interface
- Stub and skeleton being compiled
  - The stub (client side) hides the serialization of parameters and the network-level communication in order to present a simple invocation mechanism to the caller
  - The skeleton (server side) is responsible for dispatching the call to the actual remote object implementation
- The server binds methods in the RMI registry (calls the registry to associate a name with a remote object)
- RMI registry publishes proxy
- The client looks up the remote object by its name in the server's registry and then invokes a method on it
- The proxy implements and invokes method on the Remote
- The RMI layer on the Remote listens and receives the invocation and calls the relevant method of
  the Remote Object
- The RMI layer returns a response to the Client

### Same thing but with code example

The following application's code is an example of RMI interraction between the Client and the Server. In this simple implementation we will going to tell to the Server how many time we want it to say "Hello" and to report when it's done.

#### RMIInterface.java

```java
package io.github.guzzur.rmiinterface;

import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public interface RMIInterface extends Remote {
    public String sayHello(int times) throws RemoteException;
}
```

#### RMIServer.java

```java
package io.github.guzzur.rmiserver;

import java.rmi.Naming;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

import io.github.guzzur.rmiinterface.RMIInterface;

public class RMIServer extends UnicastRemoteObject implements RMIInterface {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    protected RMIServer() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    @Override
    public String sayHello(int times) throws RemoteException {
        for (int i=0; i < times; i++)
            System.out.println("Hello!");
        return "Server said hello " + times + " times";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        try {
            // In that example the registry runs within the server app
            Registry reg = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);

            Naming.rebind("//localhost/RMIServer", new RMIServer());
            System.out.println("Server ready");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Server exception: " + e.toString());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### RMIClient.java

```java
package io.github.guzzur.rmiclient;

import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.rmi.Naming;
import java.rmi.NotBoundException;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

import io.github.guzzur.rmiinterface.RMIInterface;

public class RMIClient {
    private static RMIInterface lookUp;

    public static void main(String[] args)
            throws MalformedURLException, RemoteException, NotBoundException {
        lookUp = (RMIInterface) Naming.lookup("//localhost/RMIServer");
        int times = 5;
        // Woila! Now we can use sayHello method!
        String response = lookUp.sayHello(times);
        System.out.println(response);
    }
}
```

#### Result

```
/* SERVER */
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!

/* CLIENT */
Server said hello 5 times
```
